**<span style="color:orange">PS: The folder you select must contain CSV files representing the same type of node. 
For example, if you are importing the 'City' node, your folder might include files like NewYork.csv, Chicago.csv,
etc. The tool will automatically extract the intersection of all column names across the CSV files in the selected folder
and use them as the displayed fields in the UI.</span>**

used to construct your nodes. Once you're done, click 'Next' to proceed.**
